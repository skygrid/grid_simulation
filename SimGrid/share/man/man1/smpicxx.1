.SH NAME
smpicxx \- SMPI C++ wrapper compiler
.SH SYNOPSIS
smpicxx â€¦
.SH DESCRIPTION
smpicxx is a wrapper around the C++ compiler defined when building SimGrid, adding the right flags in order to use the SimGrid library and SMPI, the MPI implementation within it. Most of the arguments filled to smpicxx will be passed to the underlying compiler directly, except for \fB\-\-version\fR which gives the SimGrid library version, and \fB\-\-compiler-version\fR which gives the C++ compiler version. Please refer to the latter documentation in case of trouble.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
All environment variables taken into account by the underlying compiler will be used by it, but note that the compiler can not be modified.
