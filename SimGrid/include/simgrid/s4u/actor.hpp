/** @ingroup s4u_api
 * 
 * An actor is an independent stream of execution in your distributed application.
 *
 * You can think of an actor as a process in your distributed application, or as a thread in a multithreaded program.
 * This is the only component in SimGrid that actually does something on its own, executing its own code. 
 * A resource will not get used if you don't schedule activities on them. This is the code of Actors that create and schedule these activities.
 * 
 * An actor is located on a (simulated) host, but it can interact
 * with the whole simulated platform.
 * 
 * The s4u::Actor API is strongly inspired from the C++11 threads.
 * The <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread">documentation 
 * of this standard</a> may help to understand the philosophy of the S4U
 * Actors. 
 * 
 * @section s4u_actor_def Defining the skeleton of an Actor
 * 
 * %As in the <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread">C++11
 * standard</a>, you can declare the code of your actor either as a
 * pure function or as an object. It is very simple with functions:
 * 
 * @code{.cpp}
 * #include "s4u/actor.hpp"
 * 
 * // Declare the code of your worker
 * void worker() {
 *   printf("Hello s4u");
 *   simgrid::s4u::this_actor::execute(5*1024*1024); // Get the worker executing a task of 5 MFlops
 * };
 * 
 * // From your main or from another actor, create your actor on the host Jupiter
 * // The following line actually creates a new actor, even if there is no "new". 
 * Actor("Alice", simgrid::s4u::Host::by_name("Jupiter"), worker);
 * @endcode
 * 
 * But some people prefer to encapsulate their actors in classes and
 * objects to save the actor state in a cleanly dedicated location.
 * The syntax is slightly more complicated, but not much.
 * 
 * @code{.cpp}
 * #include "s4u/actor.hpp"
 * 
 * // Declare the class representing your actors
 * class Worker {
 * public:
 *   void operator()() { // Two pairs of () because this defines the method called ()
 *     printf("Hello s4u");
 *     simgrid::s4u::this_actor::execute(5*1024*1024); // Get the worker executing a task of 5 MFlops
 *   }
 * };
 * 
 * // From your main or from another actor, create your actor. Note the () after Worker
 * Actor("Bob", simgrid::s4u::Host::by_name("Jupiter"), Worker());
 * @endcode
 * 
 * @section s4u_actor_flesh Fleshing your actor
 * 
 * The body of your actor can use the functions of the
 * simgrid::s4u::this_actor namespace to interact with the world.
 * This namespace contains the methods to start new activities
 * (executions, communications, etc), and to get informations about
 * the currently running thread (its location, etc).
 * 
 * Please refer to the @link simgrid::s4u::this_actor full API @endlink.
 *
 * 
 * @section s4u_actor_deploy Using a deployment file
 * 
 * @warning This is currently not working with S4U. Sorry about that.
 * 
 * The best practice is to use an external deployment file as
 * follows, because it makes it easier to test your application in
 * differing settings. Load this file with
 * s4u::Engine::loadDeployment() before the simulation starts. 
 * Refer to the @ref deployment section for more information.
 * 
 * @code{.xml}
 * <?xml version='1.0'?>
 * <!DOCTYPE platform SYSTEM "http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/simgrid/simgrid.dtd">
